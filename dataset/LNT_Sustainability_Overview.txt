ENERGY AND EMISSIONS
L&T's business operations are powered primarily by diesel and electricity. Diesel is used for powering construction machinery used for EPC projects and in a few locations in Power Generator sets for electricity generation. Electricity is used across offices, manufacturing facilities and in other equipment. These energy sources drive the carbon footprint of L&T.

WATER
L&T's water footprint is driven by consumption in EPC Projects execution, primarily due to the use of water in civil works. The consumption pattern is determined by the type of structures or works and technical specifications of such works. We are focusing on reducing water consumption as well as reducing freshwater withdrawal.

CIRCULAR ECONOMY
Execution of EPC Projects in Infrastructure projects typically entails significant consumption of natural resources as well as manufactured products from natural sources. L&T is trying to reduce resource consumption by adopting sustainable materials. Other lever to achieve this is recycling or reuse of waste generated in business processes.

Sustainable Materials
Fly ash, GGBS and Manufactured sand is used to replace cement, aggregates, and natural sand. This not only helps in reusing waste materials from other industries but also helps in reducing the embodied carbon in materials used for constructing any infrastructure asset.
Biodiversity
Trees are not only natural carbon sinks but also have other environmental benefits e.g., water retention, slowing down topsoil erosion, lowering air pollution etc. At L&T, we have been undertaking sapling plantation wherever we have significant presence.
